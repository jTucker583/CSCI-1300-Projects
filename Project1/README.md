# Song Comparison Using SPN

This program takes strings and compares them to eachother and a target string to determine
the simlarity between them. There is a function to compare them to eachother, as well as
a function to compare them to a target string. All types of input must be in SPN, or else
the function will print "Invalid input", or some variation of that, and prompt again.
